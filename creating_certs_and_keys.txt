Use openssl to create server and client keys + certs.

For the server key+cert, perform:

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key_server.pem -out cert_server.pem -days 365 -nodes

For the client key+cert, perform:

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key_client.pem -out cert_client.pem -days 365 -nodes


For servers and clients to work:
Servers must have the following in their certification directory:

	key_server.pem
	cert_server.pem
	cert_client.pem

Clients must have the following in their certification directory:

	cert_server.pem
	key_client.pem
	cert_client.pem

Do not include server's key in clients, and avoid including
the clients' keys in servers.


The meanings of some values of the openssl commands:
	- rsa:4096 is the size of the key in bits.
	- 365 specifies how long the certificate will be valid for.
	  Replace it after it expires.
